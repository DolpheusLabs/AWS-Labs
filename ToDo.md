**Cleanup Section**
- delete local CSV download
- delete keypair in ~/.ssh/
- Delete certificate private key from EC2

**Lab Instructions**
- Windows/Putty instructions for EC2 connection (maybe)
- Validate CLI config steps on Win10 ---- sir, can you take this one? I need to resurrect a windows VM, but if you have one handy to validate this piece that would be great.
